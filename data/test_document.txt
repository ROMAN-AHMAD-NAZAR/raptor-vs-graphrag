RAPTOR: Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval

Introduction
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a popular approach for enhancing large language models with external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems treat documents as flat collections of chunks, ignoring the inherent hierarchical structure of documents.

Methodology
Our approach, RAPTOR, introduces a novel method for document indexing and retrieval. We cluster related chunks using Gaussian Mixture Models, generate abstractive summaries at multiple levels, and build a tree structure that captures document semantics.

Results
Experiments show that RAPTOR outperforms traditional RAG by 25-40% on complex queries. The hierarchical structure allows for better contextual understanding and multi-hop reasoning.

Conclusion
RAPTOR provides a significant improvement over flat RAG systems by capturing document structure through recursive clustering and summarization.
